===WebIOPi is a fully integrated Internet of Things framework for the Raspberry Pi.===
   Control, debug, and use your Pi's GPIO locally or remotely, from a browser or any app.
   WebIOPi is the perfect Swiss-knife to make connected things with the Raspberry Pi.
   Developed and provided by Eric PTAK, french R&D engineer in networks, software, and Internet of Things.

===Features===
   REST API over HTTP and CoAP (draft-14) with multicast support
   Server written in Python with zero dependency
   Supports GPIO, Serial, I2C, SPI, 1-Wire with zero dependency
   Supports more than [DEVICES 30 devices] including DAC, ADC, sensors...
   Full Python library for the Server, GPIO, Serial, I2C, SPI and devices drivers
   Compatible with both Python 2 and 3
   Extensible and highly customizable
   Login/Password protection
   Mobile devices compatible
   Includes debug web apps
     GPIO Header
     GPIO List
     Serial Monitor
     Devices Monitor
   Javascript client library built on top of jQuery
   Python client library with HTTP and CoAP support

===What for===
   Use webiopi.GPIO library to control GPIO in your Python scripts
   Use devices drivers to interact with DAC, ADC, sensors and more in your Python scripts
   Use Serial, I2C and SPI webiopi classes in your Python scripts
   Use the GPIO Header web-app to play with GPIO and debug circuits
   Use the Serial Monitor web-app to debug Serial devices
   Use the Devices Monitor web-app to debug devices like DAC, ADC, sensors and more
   Create a web-app with the Javascript library to remote controls things connected on GPIO
   Add webiopi in your existing Python script to simply add all WebIOPi features
   Extends webiopi with your own macro
   Extends webiopi with scripts loading facilities in a Arduino fashion way (setup, loop, destroy)
   Use the Python Client to make Pi-2-Pi communication through the REST API
   Use the Python Multicast Client to control multiple Pis with a single REST call
   Use the Java Client to use the REST API from a Java application, including Android
   Use the REST API from any technology/language
